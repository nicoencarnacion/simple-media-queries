## Sublime Snippets

Copy and paste these snippets to your Sublime Snippets folder. You can access it by opening Sublime > Preferences > Browse Packages > User.

I suggest making a new folder for these snippets (e.g. css).

## Media Query Variables

These are very simple media query variables that I always use. Simply include them in your project's SCSS folder. These work with the sublime snippets I created above.
